# project4Angos
This repository contains a small front-end project for my interview at AngosStudio.

The project contains no back-end development. The technologies used are HTML5, Sass CSS and JQuery. 

To summarize the intent of this project, it is a web blog delivering information regarding maternity support in Brazil. It describes the conditions necessary to receive the support, according to the brazilian laws of work. 

This project is compliant with the Sass #CommunityGuidelines, as well as with the JQuery's #TOS. 💡😁
